  ## General info

The idea for creating Dance Moves App was born when I started training in a new dance school. The lack of cohesion in naming dance moves made it difficult to communicate with my instructor, so I decided to create an application to help us systematize them. Incidentally, around that time I began to learn Angular on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/?fbclid=IwAR2wtTIngBK94YRfnn0QGTGoo6Hiv9Fjh51anLqHyBc2ehA3At_9K0TzzAg) and I applied my newly acquired knowledge in practice.  
I hope you'll enjoy it! :dancer:
